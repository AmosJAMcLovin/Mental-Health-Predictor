## Background

Mental illness is a global health problem. It has critically high prevalence, yielding severe health outcomes. One in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental illness in any given year (National Alliance on Mental Health, 2013). In the tech industry, 50% of individuals have sought treatment for mental illness, according to Finkler, 2015.

This important health issue warrants further investigation. This Project, based on the 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 Mental Health in Tech Survey from Open Sourcing Mental Illness, will performs a complete data visualization, machine learning model and statistical analyses among the mental illness and various factors in order to answer following questions:

- What are the strongest groups of predictors of mental health illness in the workplace ?
- What might be the causes of the high mental illnesses prevalence in the tech industry other than some common thoughts?
- How is the representativeness of the survey, is other factors involved: geographic locations, ages, etc.?
- How does the frequency of mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location?

## Project Goal

Identifying personal and work related attributes are the top predictors in determining whether or not the person seek mental health health condition. 

## Data Source

The data sourced the survey data from the 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018 OSMI mental health in technology surveys used to facilitate analysis.

The dataset contains 27 factors that could be segmented into 5 categories.

   - Demographics: age, gender, country, state etc
   - Mental Health Condition : treatment, work interference, family history etc.
   - Employment Background : tech, remote, employee number, size etc.
   - Organizational Policies on Mental Health : benefit, wellness program etc.
   - Openness about Mental Health : self awareness, coworkers, supervisors, openness to discuss etc.
