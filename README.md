## Background

Mental illness is a global health problem. It has critically high prevalence, yielding severe health outcomes. One in four adults suffer from a diagnosable mental illness in any given year (National Alliance on Mental Health, 2013).

These important health issues warrant further investigation. This Project will perform a complete data visualization, machine learning model and statistical analysis among mental illness and various factors in order to answer following questions:

- 

## Project Goal

Identifying personal and work related attributes are the top predictors in determining whether or not the person has a mental health condition. 

## Data Source

The data sourced the survey data from OSMI mental health in technology surveys, and used to facilitate analysis.

The dataset contains 27 factors that could be segmented into 5 categories.

   - Demographics: age, gender, country, state etc.
   - Mental Health Condition : treatment, work interference, family history etc.
   - Employment Background : tech, remote, employee number, size etc.
   - Organizational Policies on Mental Health : benefit, wellness program etc.
   - Openness about Mental Health : self awareness, coworkers, supervisors, openness to discuss etc. 
 #### The Survey data maped as follows:
