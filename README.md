## Background

Mental illness is a global health problem. It has critically high prevalence, yielding severe health outcomes. One in four adults suffer from a diagnosable mental illness in any given year (National Alliance on Mental Health, 2013).

These important health issues warrant further investigation. This Project is based on the 2014 Mental Health in Tech Survey from Open Sourcing Mental Illness. It will perform a complete data visualization, machine learning model and statistical analysis among mental illness and various factors in order to answer following questions:

- What are the strongest groups of predictors for mental health illness in the workplace?
- What might be some of the causes for high mental illnesses presence in the tech industry other than personal problems? e.g.) addiction, income, etc.
- How is the representativeness of the survey? Are other factors involved such as geographic locations, age or gender?
- How does the frequency of mental health illness and attitude towards mental health vary by geographical location?

## Project Goal

Identifying personal and work related attributes are the top predictors in determining whether or not the person has a mental health condition. 

## Data Source

The data sourced the survey data from OSMI mental health in technology surveys, and used to facilitate analysis.
- https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/home

The dataset contains 27 factors that could be segmented into 5 categories.

   - Demographics: age, gender, country, state etc.
   - Mental Health Condition : treatment, work interference, family history etc.
   - Employment Background : tech, remote, employee number, size etc.
   - Organizational Policies on Mental Health : benefit, wellness program etc.
   - Openness about Mental Health : self awareness, coworkers, supervisors, openness to discuss etc. 
 #### The Survey data maped as follows:
